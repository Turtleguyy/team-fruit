    for the latest and greatest of Fruity wonder.

  %p From a very young age, Mr. Fruit was loved by everyone around him. Even in the oldest of photos, he is shown surrounded by friends and family. They were always very supportive of him and all of his endeavors, which is quite fortunate because they were many.

    Like many other great minds of our time, Fruit always believed his future lay outside the world of academic achievement. He tried a plethora of things while growing up, and after many
    %span{ title: 'complete failures' } "near" successes
    , he found he had a knack for politics. And so, Mr. Fruit set off on a long and epic campaign trail.

  %p At first, the people were more shocked than anything else. They had never seen such political prowess as displayed by Fruit and his crack campaign team. The videos and posters released to the public had a truly awe inspiring effect, the likes of which has never been seen before or since. Sadly, the bright and Fruity future that lay ahead was cut short when it became clear the world was not yet ready for such greatness.

  %p Picking up the pieces from the shambles of yet another near success, Fruit marched on. After some careful examination and observation, he decided to do the only sensible thing any person would do. He pivoted career paths and barrelled head-first into the modeling industry.

  %p For some reason still unknown to this day, he only ever wanted to be a car model. More specifically, a van model. He spent some time doing various high profile gigs around the world, always with different and increasingly exotic vans. Just when it seemed Fruit would live happily ever after in his new profession, the industry began to shut him out. It seemed that they too were not ready such Fruity splendor.

  %p
    At this point, Fruit was running out of ideas. One day, while he was at home recuperating, he recorded himself playing a video game merely on a whim. He put the video on something called YouTube, and was astonished at the
    %span{ title: 'years of hard work and determination' } near instant
    fame and success. Since then, he has continued making videos, finding it to be the
    %span{ title: 'hardest and most demanding' } easiest
    and most rewarding thing he'd ever put his mind to. Finally, Mr. Fruit was happy.
